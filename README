Start the bot via "./freenode-main.rkt" at the shell.  I think doing
"racket freenode-main.rkt" will fail mysteriously.

Getting an error about "rackunit" not being available?  That can be
caused by using the "racket-textual" package instead of "racket".

specs etc:
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459
http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/ctcpspec.html

Run the tests like this:

    $ raco test -x .

Unfortunately, you'll have to pay attention to the output of "raco
test", since it will likely exit with 0 status even if some of the
tests fail.  This is IMHO a misfeature of "raco test"; the Racket
developers seem disinclined to change it (see
http://bugs.racket-lang.org/query/?cmd=view&pr=13573).
