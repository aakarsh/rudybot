Start the bot via "./freenode-main.rkt" at the shell.  I think doing
"racket freenode-main.rkt" will fail mysteriously.

Getting an error about "rackunit" not being available?  That can be
caused by using the "racket-textual" package instead of "racket".

specs etc:
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459
http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/ctcpspec.html

Run the tests like this:

    $ raco test .
